89.23.107.113:80 <- 0 samples on VT, VT rating 6/88, source is my own script scanning the global internet for Raccoon C2s on 03.08.2023. Seen ones. Might be considered a FP due to lack of samples. No way to check if detection by script was FP. However never had a FP report for Raccon Script results afaik. Same ASN as true positive below.

172.0.0.1:80
172.0.0.1:443  <- IP 172.0.0.1 is a very difficult one. There is 214 samples on VT. Majority being malicious. There is 2 NJRat and 1 AsyncRat sample. Also malicious. The IP is owned by AT&T. It is therefor a legitimate ip adress. However, I do believe there is a high chance of FPs here. It could be ThreatActors (and even researchers) trying out their tools and misstyping localhost IP. I leave the decision of deletion to you.
